The documents cover various topics such as news, sports, and politics, but there is no mention of the claim's topic. This lack of evidence supporting the claim suggests that it is likely fake.\n",

The text states that the first declaration was made by WHO, and the second declaration was also made by WHO, with a gap of almost a year between the two declarations. This suggests that WHO has taken formal action to declare a global health emergency in response to the surge in mpox cases and the potential risk of further spread.

The evidence also mentions that the mission was a result of ISRO's four-year journey and was considered a triumph after overcoming earlier failures.
